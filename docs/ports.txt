|         PORTS OF KISS TO OTHER ARCHITECTURES          |
|                                                       |
| * KISS has been ported to various architectures by    |
|   the community. The following projects aren't        |
|   affiliated with KISS.                               |
|                                                       |
| * While KISS only officially supports x86_64, Changes |
|   are made to KISS (where possible) to make the       |
|   porting process easier.                             |
|                                                       |
