|                 KISS PACKAGE MANAGER                  |
|                                                       |
| * The KISS package manager is a self-contained POSIX  |
|   shell script which is written in a highly portable  |
|   way.                                                |
|                                                       |
| * The entire utility comes in at under 1000 lines of  |
|   code (excluding blank lines/comments of which there |
|   are many).                                          |
|                                                       |
| * The package manager is merely an implementation of  |
|   the package format, its requirements and some sugar |
|   on top.                                             |
|                                                       |

|  * POSIX utilities are used where appropriate _and_   |
|    where they exist to solve a particular problem.    |
|                                                       |
|  * Utilities of which there is only a single and      |
|    cross-platform implementation are considered       |
|    "portable" (git, curl, etc)                        |
|                                                       |
|  * If a dependency can be made optional, it will be   |
|    made so. Dependencies are also kept to a minimum   |
|    (though we must also remain realistic).            |
|                                                       |

|                                                       |
|                                                       |
| [1] Git is also required for contribution to the      |
|     distribution itself. Strictly speaking, nothing   |
|     forces you to use git. Remote repositories and    |
|     git based sources will simply become unusable.    |
|                                                       |
| [2] There is no standard utility for the generation   |
|     of sha256 checksums. While sha256sum is listed    |
|     above, the package manager also supports sha256,  |
|     shasum and openssl as fallbacks.                  |
|                                                       |
| [3] The tar command has no standard! This came as a   |
|     shock. The POSIX equivalent is "pax" though this  |
|     isn't in wide use (on Linux).                     |
|                                                       |
|     Our usage of tar is merely, -cf, -xf and -tf with |
|     support for cf, xf and tf as fallbacks. Not all   |
|     tar implementations support both input types.     |
|                                                       |
|     Our usage of tar cannot become any more basic     |
|     than it is now. Portability should no longer be   |
|     a concern.                                        |
|                                                       |
|     Tested tar implementations include: busybox,      |
|     toybox, sbase, GNU and libarchive (though all tar |
|     implementations should work).                     |
|                                                       |
| [4] These three compression methods are required as   |
|     pretty much every package source uses them as the |
|     tarball compression method.                       |
|                                                       |
|     The other compression methods are optional as no  |
|     package sources (in the official repositories)    |
|     make use of them.                                 |
|                                                       |
|     If a compression method has 1-3 uses (hasn't yet  |
|     happened), the compression method will simply     |
|     become a 'make' dependency of the package until   |
|     usage increases to a "normality".                 |
|                                                       |
| [5] A privilege escalation utility is only needed     |
|     when using the package manager as a normal user   |
|     for system-wide package installation.             |
|                                                       |
|     Installation to a user-writable directory does    |
|     not require root access.                          |
|                                                       |
|     Root usage of the package manager (chroot usage   |
|     for example) does not require these utilities.    |
|                                                       |

|                                                       |
| * Runtime dependency detector built around 'ldd'.     |
|                                                       |
|   Dynamic dependencies brought in by build systems    |
|   (which are missing from the package's dependency    |
|   list) are fixed on-the-fly by checking which        |
|   libraries link to the package's files.              |
|                                                       |
|   This prevents an incomplete dependency list from    |
|   causing system breakage as the package manager is   |
|   able to complete the list.                          |
|                                                       |
|   A lot of packages make use of this "implicit" to    |
|   "explicit" dependency list "conversion" to provide  |
|   optional dependencies.                              |

| * Fully dynamic (and automatic) alternatives system.  |
|                                                       |
|   Any file conflicts between two packages             |
|   automatically become choices in the alternatives    |
|   system.                                             |
|                                                       |
|   This allows one to swap providers of files without  |
|   needing to explicitly tell the package manager      |
|   that two packages conflict, provide the same        |
|   utilities, etc.                                     |
|                                                       |
|   In other words, no changes need to be made to       |
|   packages. In fact, nothing needs to be done at all. |
|   It's entirely automatic.                            |

|   alternatives listing is directly usable as input    |
|   to 'kiss a'.                                        |
