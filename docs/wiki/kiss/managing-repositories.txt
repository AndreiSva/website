MANAGING REPOSITORIES
________________________________________________________________________________

Repository management in KISS is very simple. Repositories are configurable via
an environment variable. This environment variable can be set system-wide,
per-user, conditionally (via a script or program), for a single invocation, etc.

The environment variable is called '$KISS_PATH' and is functionally identical to
the '$PATH' variable. A colon separated list of paths in other words.

Example: KISS_PATH=/var/db/kiss/repo/core:/var/db/kiss/repo/extra

In the above example, two repositories are enabled (Core and Extra). The package
manager will search this list for packages in the order it is written.

Repositories can live anywhere on the system. In your '$HOME' directory,
somewhere system-wide in '/', etc. The only requirement is that a full path be
used.


What is a repository?
________________________________________________________________________________

A KISS repository is simply a directory of directories. The quickest way to get
started is as follows.

# Create the repository.
$ mkdir -p repo
$ cd repo

# Let's 'fork' a few packages into our new repository.
$ kiss fork curl
$ kiss fork xz
$ kiss fork zlib

This is now a fully usable repository and it can be added to your '$KISS_PATH'.


Enabling the Community repository
________________________________________________________________________________

Let's assume that our '$KISS_PATH' matches the above example (Core and Extra).
Enabling the Community repository is as follows.

$ git clone https://github.com/kisslinux/community
$ export KISS_PATH=$KISS_PATH:/path/to/community/community


Preventing a package from receiving updates
________________________________________________________________________________

Preventing a package from receiving updates can be accomplished in a myriad of
different ways. The easiest method is to leverage a user repository.

# Create a new repository.
$ mkdir -p no_updates
$ cd no_updates

# Copy the package you would like to prevent from updating to the
# new repository.
$ cp -r /var/db/kiss/installed/<pkg_name> /path/to/no_updates

# Add the new repository to the _start_ of your $KISS_PATH.
$ export KISS_PATH=/path/to/no_updates:$KISS_PATH

The package manager will search KISS_PATH in order. It will see that the
no_updates repository provides <pkg_name> and the version matches that which
is installed. No updates will again happen for the package.


Package fallbacks
________________________________________________________________________________

If you would like to package something in your own repository but would like
the package manager to prefer other repositories before yours, simply add your
repository to the end of '$KISS_PATH'.

The moment that your package is available elsewhere, the package manager will
prefer the new location to yours. The list is searched (in order) and the first
match is picked.


Bypassing KISS_PATH
________________________________________________________________________________

There is a special case where one can bypass the regular '$KISS_PATH' for a
single invocation of the package manager. This has been called "CRUX-like usage"
by users.

$ cd /path/to/myrepo/firefox
$ kiss b
$ kiss i

As seen above, various package manager commands will work without arguments,
so long as you are in a package's repository directory. This will prepend the
current directory to '$KISS_PATH' _only_ for this invocation.
