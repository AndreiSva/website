SCROT [0]
________-_______________________________________________________________________

Scrot is a minimalist command line screen capturing application. It allows
substantial degree of flexibility by specifying parameters on command line,
including the ability to invoke a third-party utility to manipulate the
resulting screenshot.


Description
-_______________________________________________________________________________

Features of the program include the ability to limit the scope of capturing to
a specific screen area, to set the delay (if needed to capture some menu or
another UI element which is shown only when focused) and to specify the
filename template using wildcards (including those of the strftime function
from the C standard library).[3] Other features include creating thumbnails of
the taken screenshots and specifying the quality of the resulting image if
lossy format is required.[4]

The scrot utility follows the UNIX philosophy principles formulated by Doug
McIlroy: the only thing it does is screen capturing, though it allows one to
specify a command for further manipulations of a resulting file.[5]

The ability to control scrot from the command line allows the user to run it
over the network with tools like OpenSSH to get a screenshot of a remote
desktop[6] or execute it as the window manager command binding.[7]

Scrot was forked as part of the Resurrecting Open Source Project.[8] This
updated fork is being used for the Arch Linux package of scrot.
