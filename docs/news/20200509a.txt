The kernel compiled with GCC 10.1.0 may crash on boot. This doesn't
seem to affect every system. I have thus far received a single report
by an affected user.

Attached below is a patch which has been reported to fix the issue.
This fix has not yet made it into a kernel release (let alone Linus'
tree).

I recommend applying the patch if compiling a kernel with GCC 10.1.0.
An additional note will be added to the installation guide for the
benefit of new users.
